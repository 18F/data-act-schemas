# DATA ACT SCHEMAS

Some preliminary schema experimentation around potential schemas for Data Act implementation.

## Protocol Buffers

The first round of experimentation is around using protocol buffers to represent the initial pilot. There are two files here:

* USSGL.proto:
  * A representation of the current data as it exists in the pilot db.
* accounting_entry.proto:
  * A representation that maps directly to the output format in the pilot.
